                <p><small><strong>Last Updated: November 28, 2020</strong></small></p>
                <p>In an effort to be transparent about the grand, elusive, bloodthirsty deity called &ldquo;Marketing,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve compiled some data from my recent promotional experiments. Keep in mind that my book is very dark and very weird, so I&rsquo;m sure everyone&rsquo;s results would be different utilizing these methods.</p>
                <p><a class="button scrollSection" href="#data"><span class="hide-mobile">Shut up, Halo, &amp; </span>give me the data! <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></a></p>
                <p><strong>Or listen to me ramble below:</strong></p>
                <p>Let me preface this by saying that, in the beginning, Twitter was great, and I still believe it&rsquo;s a wonderful place to start and maintain a presence. The community is supportive, encouraging, and full of beautiful humans. You get street cred, like a runner for a gang, and plenty of interaction for the ravenous algorithm. However, at some point, you&rsquo;ll reach a plateau, and Twitter becomes what some term an &ldquo;echo chamber.&rdquo; For me, most of my followers are fellow authors also hustling to sell their books (which are all incredible stories), and authors don&rsquo;t have nearly as much time as readers do.</p>
                <p>Four months after launch, I found that everyone who wanted my book had already bought it, and my KDP reports plunged into banging-my-head-against-a-wall territory. I am NOT telling anyone to stop the lifts or social media promotions&mdash;if they&rsquo;re working for you, that&rsquo;s fantastic, and I&rsquo;m thrilled for you, truly. I&rsquo;m only here to let people know that, if they&rsquo;re not working for your book, you aren&rsquo;t alone.</p>
                <p>Anyway, sales have been celibate for some time now. April 2020 was a great month, but since then, prosperity has shriveled up like a raisin or a more inappropriate metaphor I&rsquo;ll save for my fleshy fiction. I&rsquo;m lucky if I sell a book a week at this point, so I figured I&rsquo;d go all in and reinvest my total profits from both books into paid promotional opportunities. Go big, or go home, right? Or maybe go big, or go broke&hellip;</p>
                <p>My books are cheap <em>af</em>, $0.99 each (ebook versions), so (at the time of writing) I only profited $233 over ~1 year of mostly Twitter promos (writer lifts, begging on my knees, sacrificing goats to our Lord Nicolas Cage, etc.). I didn&rsquo;t want to waste this money, however, so I researched opportunities with good ROI. I tried to think from a small business&rsquo;s perspective instead of from an author&rsquo;s perspective. The goal was to get my book into as many hands as possible&mdash;to create an army of loyal, Valhalla-bound minions to spread the word of my creepy and macabre book monsters to legions worldwide. So I ran a couple of free book promotions, one using only social media and one using the paid services, and then I compared the results (because I&rsquo;m a nerd).</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve used these in the past with good results (but this is before I started harvesting goats and data, so I don&rsquo;t have sexy analytics).</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve combed through many of these sites and found a few great options/reviewers. In keeping with transparency, I will say that I emailed hundreds of review requests and only received about a dozen answers. So, like everything with writing, you have to scream into the void for a good while before you get a whisper back. Donâ€™t let this dissuade you; waiting for responses is a great time for Nic Cage GIFs.</p>
