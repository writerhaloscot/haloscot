                <h2>Go on. Read an excerpt.</h2>
                <p>The uniform itched with responsibility, with the weight of over one thousand lives. When she moved, the silver badge, a phoenix, poked her shoulder, reminded her of duty. Beneath it were the words &ldquo;United Air Force, Space Division,&rdquo; and clipped to her collar was her UAF rank insignia, the rank of captain.</p>
                <p>A captain. Did she ever imagine such a possibility? She was the captain of a starship, and not only a starship, but the first starship ever created, the <em>SS Exodus</em>. And with that honor came a crushing responsibility.</p>
                <p>She sat alone in her office, a tiny room outside the bridge, cozy with wooden furniture and amber lighting. One of the few spaces on the ship that wasn&rsquo;t metal, it reminded her most of home. A translucent mirage of her face ghosted the window. She was a wiry woman, mid-sixties, and wore her silver hair straight and sheared off at the shoulders. Her intense, gray eyes stared back at her, skeptical. Or perhaps, the proper term was cynical.</p>
                <p>She sighed and pulled up a schematic on her desk console. <em>Exodus</em> was supposed to encourage progress in an otherwise despondent world, but in truth, she was hideous.</p>
                <p>The ship was a haphazard, celestial barge constructed from eclectic components. She was a mismatched jumble of facets and corners built for practical purposes with no mind to the aesthetic. It was a wonder she flew at all, given her makeshift assembly. Four engines attached to each of the four back corners of the long, rectangular prism. A Subspace Reactor powered these engines, and Ion Thrusters were scattered along the hull for sublight speeds.</p>
                <p>NASA poured their dwindling funds into this project. They cut everything else…except for the satellite program, but most of that moved to private agencies. It made Helen uneasy. Nearly six thousand satellites sat in Earth&rsquo;s orbit. SatComm claimed they were for data-tracking, or more specifically, &ldquo;predictive analytics.&rdquo; Two months ago, they installed transponders in compliance with the Global Congress&rsquo;s Open Disclosure Policies. And everyone signed blindly.</p>
                <p>Helen had a bad feeling about this. Spying on their own citizens was not right. Collecting terabytes of data about their personal lives was outright wrong. Then again, maybe she was just traditional. She chuckled. No one had called her that before.</p>
                <p>The console chirped with a reminder. She had one unread message. The timestamp was January 8th, 2116, over five months ago. She grimaced. It was from her brother, the only one brave enough to reach out to her. He was probably chastised for doing so. Coming from a strict Amish upbringing, her career choice drove a rift between her and her family she could never overcome.</p>
                <p>But Baron at least made an effort. She should reply. He had tried to listen, at least, which is more than she could say of her parents. Their looks of disgust when she told them were forever burned in her mind. She cast them from her thoughts. She couldn&rsquo;t let that anger resurface now, not with all that was at stake.</p>
                <p>The console chirped again. It had been reminding her twice an hour for almost half a year now. Where did he even find a computer in their community? How did he know how to use it? Perhaps she wasn&rsquo;t the only rebel in the family. Before she could change her mind, she pressed “open.”</p>
                <p><em>HELEN, THERE&rsquo;S STILL TIME TO COME HOME.</em></p>
                <p>Another disappointment. He was in denial. She would never come home, unless they apologized, which would never happen. Annoyed, she dragged the message into the trash.</p>

                <hr />
                <h2>Go crazy. Read another.</h2>
                <p>The alarm screams at me. It&rsquo;s six in the morning. I let it continue, let its clamor vibrate my skull until my ears ring. It&rsquo;s the only reminder I&rsquo;m alive.</p>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m freezing. The bed is cold since he left. I swing my legs over the side and pull on leggings and a sweatshirt. I am mechanic. I am routine. It keeps the memories at bay.</p>
                <p>
                    I run on the street, alone, isolated. I&rsquo;m not good at running. I&rsquo;m not good at anything. I was good at love &mdash; at being a wife, a mother &mdash; but now, that&rsquo;s gone, and I&rsquo;m left hollow, a shell.</p>
                <p>
                    Three miles pass in silence with only the dull thud of my footfalls to mark the passing of time. I don&rsquo;t listen to music anymore. All music reminds me of her&#8230;and of him. I&rsquo;ve learned to live without it, to live without feeling. As soon as I wake, I disconnect from myself. I go through the motions, follow the script, until at last respite comes with the fall of night.</p>
                <p>
                    I hate showering. The water opens me up, exposes the scars you can and can&rsquo;t see. I&rsquo;m always too cold or too hot, never comfortable, never content. I wash quickly, don&rsquo;t bother to shave or apply makeup. No one looks. No one cares.</p>
                <p>
                    Clothes hold me together, steady me, cover what I need to hide, what I try to forget.</p>
                <p>
                    The drive to work is two hours each way. It&rsquo;s good for me. Erases time. Shortens the day. Gives me less space for choice. I listen to the radio to drown out my thoughts. Only the weather. Anything else could make me remember.</p>
                <p>
                    I pull into the parking lot of WAnalysis &mdash; an awful name for an awful company. The building looks like it belongs thirty years ago. It&rsquo;s an uninspired cube with a few rose bushes around the front, a pathetic excuse for decoration. The outside is a hideous beige, and the inside is sterile.</p>
                <p>
                    I enter the office. Panic grabs my heart like a fist. Rows of coffins masquerade as cubicles. Fluorescent lights shine with penetrating brightness. I take a steady breath, obeying what my useless therapist said. It only makes me hyperventilate.</p>
                <p>
                    My desk is in the center of a catacomb of cubicles. I&rsquo;m away from windows, doors, break rooms, and any other reminders I&rsquo;m human. It&rsquo;s a prison I freely admit myself to. The confinement from the world removes all reminders of another life, another dream.</p>
                <p>
                    I open my email. Seventy-one unread messages. Most are pointless. Alerts from social media, invites to office parties, dribble disguised as discussion, high-priority nonsense. I delete them all.</p>
                <p>
                    My task board dings as a ticket is assigned to me. Estimates for the new project. I&rsquo;ll do it later. With no hope for growth and no mobility, I make no effort at completing assignments promptly. I&rsquo;ll be a project manager here on an intern&rsquo;s salary treated like a teenager until the day I die. I&rsquo;m in no rush for the nepotistic management to patronize me, so I wade in the monotony as long as I can.</p>
                <p>
                    I waste time by formatting a spreadsheet. Management changes their minds so often, I&rsquo;m afraid to start something that might be rendered useless by their indecision. I glance around at my fellow colleagues. They&rsquo;re experts at feigning focus as well. I&rsquo;ve forgotten most of their names, but I remember their tragedies, the reasons that trap them here, unable to find work anywhere else. Cancer. Diabetes. Anxiety. Ex-military. The company will hire them, and they&rsquo;ll use and abuse them like the rest of the system.</p>
                <p>
                    Elsewhere, people I used to know in what feels like another life are succeeding beautifully. They rocket toward personal and professional advancement, adding children and salaries and positions to their ever-growing pile of triumphs. I&rsquo;m not. I dive toward a bottomless pit, tortured into relentless submission by wave after wave of rejections, weighed down by proven pessimism.</p>
                <p>
                    Childhood is when I learned to dream. Adolescence is when I learned to grow. My twenties were supposed to be when I learned what I was made of. But I&rsquo;m not made of anything, not anymore. And as I approach thirty, I can&rsquo;t help but compare everything I haven&rsquo;t accomplished to everything everyone else has. They have families, careers, hobbies. I am a divorced ex-mother with no passions and no goals.</p>
                <p>
                    I have a meeting in ten minutes. I walk to the bathroom to kill more time. On my way out, I nearly collide with my manager, Carol. She&rsquo;s a tall, scrawny, middle-aged woman with wiry black hair and too much eyeliner.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;What were you doing?&rdquo; she shouts at me. Her face is red, and her body quivers with rage.</p>
                <p>
                    Taken off-guard, I stagger backward, blink, try to collect myself. &ldquo;I was in the bathroom,&rdquo; I say, confused about what I could have possibly done to cause her such anger.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;The meeting is starting in a couple minutes,&rdquo; she snaps.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;m still on time,&rdquo; I say.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be smart with me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    If this was before I lost her, I would have quit on the spot for this and for so many other unprofessional interactions. But, as it is, this is not before. This is now, and for what I did, or rather for what I could not do, I deserve the harassment.</p>
                <p>
                    We are the first two in the conference room, despite Carol&rsquo;s insistence I was late. We wait in awkward silence until the rest of our meager department files in. There are Jim and Earl, the golf-obsessed salesmen, along with Susan, the neurotic developer, and Gladys, the absent-minded designer. Even though everyone else is five minutes late, Carol says nothing to them. I was singled out, as usual.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Jim, I could only do nine holes till the knee started bothering me, and you know how Penny gets if I&rsquo;m late,&rdquo; Earl says as he and Jim take their seats across from me.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Count yourself lucky it&rsquo;s not your back,&rdquo; Jim says. &ldquo;My kids got me into acupuncture, but nothing works as well as beer, am I right?&rdquo; He chortles and places his hands over his large stomach.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;What meeting is this?&rdquo; Gladys asks, a half-smile always on her face.</p>
                <p>
                    Susan&rsquo;s wide eyes dart back and forth across the room as if she&rsquo;s scanning lines of code. &ldquo;The Anderson estimate, the website for the tire company.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    Carol pulls up a spreadsheet on the projector. &ldquo;I divided this out by widget and by role. Any questions before we begin?&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Yeah, Carol, I got one.&rdquo; Jim shifts forward in his chair. &ldquo;Anderson said he wanted to add an account portal to the project. That&rsquo;s not too much work, is it?&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    Susan starts twitching. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not built into the template. They would need to increase funding by at least fifty percent.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t afford anymore. He was hoping we could squeeze it in.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t &lsquo;squeeze in&rsquo; an account portal,&rdquo; Susan says, nervous. &ldquo;The functionality involved is highly complex, not to mention the API calls, payment processing, and styling.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I do styling,&rdquo; Gladys says, examining the tip of a pen. We ignore her.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t lose this client, Susan,&rdquo; Carol says, her voice stern.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I understand, but we also have to make a profit,&rdquo; Susan says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been in the red for the past three months.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Let our sales team worry about that.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not worrying about it enough!&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;What if we offer a third-party solution?&rdquo; I interject.</p>
                <p>
                    Carol glares at me. &ldquo;You mean send their business elsewhere?&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;They&rsquo;d value us more if we were honest,&rdquo; I say as calm as I can. &ldquo;If they can&rsquo;t afford for us to build it, we propose an alternate solution and help them configure the tool at minimal expense. We keep the client, strengthen our relationship, and make a profit.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I am sick and tired of your attitude today, Matilda,&rdquo; Carol says.</p>
                <p>
                    I have no attitude nor would depression allow for one. Irate at being unjustly accused, I say in the same composed tone, &ldquo;I am merely suggesting&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Matilda, as secretary, I doubt you have the skillset to provide critical feedback,&rdquo; Earl interrupts.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I&rsquo;m project manager,&rdquo; I say, but he doesn&rsquo;t listen.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I want to hear what Jim has to say,&rdquo; Carol says.</p>
                <p>
                    I wish I could feel the fury I know should be there, but I&rsquo;m only numb. They ask again about solutions I&rsquo;ve already provided, solutions they refuse to act on, because they don&rsquo;t value my opinion. I&rsquo;m too young, too short, and too quiet to be taken seriously. I&rsquo;m not anyone&rsquo;s daughter or anyone&rsquo;s friend, so according to office politics, I&rsquo;m no one of importance.</p>
                <p>
                    Jim prattles on, over-complicating the project. We&rsquo;ll be over-budget again, because no one listens to me, and no one with power has the spine to educate the client and define requirements beforehand. An hour passes of people saying much and meaning little. They&rsquo;d make good politicians. I zone out, fixate on a smudge on the table and try not to think about her, about him, about anything.</p>
                <p>
                    The meeting runs over. We have no answers, and Jim added unnecessary complexity. The estimate is a mess. Everyone is annoyed, so I slip out before they can ask me more.</p>
                <p>
                    By the time I make it back to my cubicle, everyone else is at lunch. It makes no difference. They always go to lunch without me. We&rsquo;re all miserable, but they cling to each other while I prefer to suffer alone. I don&rsquo;t want their company, but I would have liked their notice. I&rsquo;m invisible to everyone except for him, but even he left in the end.</p>
                <p>
                    As I walk toward the door, Carol cuts me off.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she asks, snippy.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Lunch,&rdquo; I say in the most even-tempered voice I can manage. I sound respectful, at least to my ears.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take lunch so late.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only one,&rdquo; I object. And the meeting ran over, because of you and your incompetence.</p>
                <p>
                    Carol jabs a finger at me. &ldquo;Stop it. Backtalk will get you nowhere. Go.&rdquo; She scoffs and walks off.</p>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m so used to her berating condescension that none of it fazes me anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    I usually walk outside during lunch, but it&rsquo;s rainy, and I forgot an umbrella. There&rsquo;s a stairwell on the bottom level I find. I climb the three flights in silence &mdash; up and down, up and down &mdash; for thirty minutes before returning to purgatory. By now, I&rsquo;m skilled at shutting down my mind and allowing only my body to wander.</p>
                <p>
                    More idle tasks and needless meetings fill the afternoon. Panic brews again. I&rsquo;m trapped. I can&rsquo;t escape. No matter how many jobs I apply for or how many interviews I have, I&rsquo;m given no mercy.</p>
                <p>
                    No one wants me. I&rsquo;m worthless. I&rsquo;m nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    Carol leans on my cubicle. &ldquo;The vector files for Anderson&rsquo;s logos came in. I need you to mockup a couple of mobile versions.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I say, hesitant, &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t that something Gladys normally does?&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    Carol narrows her eyes. &ldquo;I need you to do your job.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    This isn&rsquo;t my job. Most of what I do isn&rsquo;t my job. I&rsquo;m a slave to the whims and desires of whatever futile direction they aim to steer the dying company in next, forced to learn new roles and responsibilities overnight. If I could feel, I would be furious. But I&rsquo;m too tired to fight.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I say.</p>
                <p>
                    The rest of the afternoon is uneventful until one of our websites crashes. Of course, I am blamed.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Matilda, get in here,&rdquo; Carol shouts from a conference room.</p>
                <p>
                    I oblige, laptop in hand, trudging through the hallway like a corpse. When I enter the room, Susan&rsquo;s tapping away like a pianist on her keyboard, and Jim is sitting in the corner, brow creased and lips pursed.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; I ask.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a plugin conflict,&rdquo; Susan says, anxious. She doesn&rsquo;t look up.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;How could this have happened?&rdquo; Jim asks no one in particular.</p>
                <p>
                    Your ineptitude. Your ignorance. Your lack of attention.</p>
                <p>
                    I used to be a developer, so I run through my usual list of suspects. &ldquo;Was there a deployment?&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Susan shakes her head erratically.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Updates?&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    Susan is quiet for a moment, searching the code. &ldquo;No plugin updates, but there was an update to the core.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Auto or manual?&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Auto.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I turned off auto-updates for this reason,&rdquo; I say, fighting to keep the asperity from my voice.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;And I told Susan to turn them back on,&rdquo; Carol says.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t help but ask.</p>
                <p>
                    Carol shoots me a warning glance. She hates explaining herself. &ldquo;Because of budget concerns.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    I take a deep breath, steady myself, force myself to act professional despite the idiots around me.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Auto-updates increase the possibility of code conflicts,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;We need to make manual updates in a staging environment, thoroughly test, and then deploy to production.&rdquo; I have said this all a million times, but they didn&rsquo;t listen, and now it crashed, and I&rsquo;m the one they blame.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;The client couldn&rsquo;t afford our base package,&rdquo; Carol says. &ldquo;It was auto-update or lose the client.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    Then get better clients, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;These decisions don&rsquo;t concern you,&rdquo; Jim says.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;These decisions are not best practices,&rdquo; I say.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Just tell us how to fix it.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    I sigh and resign myself to submission. &ldquo;Susan, roll back the core update.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    Susan does, and the site comes back up.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Now turn off auto-updates,&rdquo; I say.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do that,&rdquo; Carol says. &ldquo;The site needs to stay updated.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;but the site also needs to stay live. If they can&rsquo;t afford proper testing, then we should freeze the site at the current core and plugin versions, because we know they work.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not the way it should be done, but it is a compromise that should cause fewer problems down the line.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Carol says, tentative. She hates ceding to me even when I&rsquo;m right. Especially when I&rsquo;m right.</p>
                <p>
                    I leave without asking and return to my cubicle. Dull sparks of aggravation prick my mind. I ignore them and sink once more into the stagnant gravity of depression.</p>
                <p>
                    I turn on a podcast about sixteenth-century hygiene practices. It&rsquo;s enough to lull me into a boredom bereft of will or thoughts. An hour passes without incident until Carol finds me again.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; she asks curtly.</p>
                <p>
                    I take out my earbuds. &ldquo;Entering my time.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Do that later. I want you to get certified in ChargeTek.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    ChargeTek is a payment processing app used by one-percent of the industry. It&rsquo;s glitchy, bug-ridden, and unreliable. The certification will cost the company a thousand dollars, and there is only one potential client who might sign. It&rsquo;s a terrible business decision and money down the drain.</p>
                <p>
                    Also, it&rsquo;s not related to project management at all, but my title has long been a falsified formality. It should be &ldquo;Project Manager / Senior Developer / Quality Assurance Analyst / Search Engine Optimization Specialist / Graphic Designer,&rdquo; but then they&rsquo;d have to pay me more. This is filler work, at best, and I can promise it will amount to nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    We dig for scraps at the bottom of the barrel, desperate for any work that comes our way. We should choose one thing to focus on instead of dividing our dwindling resources between too many disparate ventures. A surgeon isn&rsquo;t a rocket scientist isn&rsquo;t a psychologist isn&rsquo;t a carpenter. Not all skills are transferable. We have to specialize at some point to succeed. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I doubt the client will sign, and if they do, I guarantee they will leave within the year.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I say.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you an email with the details,&rdquo; Carol says. She thinks our variety highlights our versatility, but it only highlights our amateurism, changing job titles for whomever is foolish enough to hire us.</p>
                <p>
                    The certification is even more tedious than my usual tasks. I struggle through the first section over a couple hours and take a coffee break. When I return to my desk, Earl is waiting for me.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Hello, Matilda.&rdquo; He leans against the flimsy side of my cubicle wall, thumbing through the free calendar I hung up for decoration. It showcases twelve months of random mountain ranges. I thought it would be inspiring, but it only reminds me that I&rsquo;m beyond inspiration.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Earl.&rdquo; I hope he leaves soon. Earl has a habit of unloading his personal troubles on unwary victims.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Carol wants you to learn @B, that new programming language they&rsquo;re using in Silicon Valley,&rdquo; he says.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;She told me to learn ChargeTek,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Which is priority?&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;This is,&rdquo; Earl says and mercifully leaves.</p>
                <p>
                    I switch gears and study @B. The syntax is familiar, but the variable casting is all new. We need to standardize our toolset. I push the thought away. Stop caring. I&rsquo;m about halfway through the first chapter when Carol returns.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;How far along are you with ChargeTek?&rdquo; she asks.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I finished a section, but Earl said you want me to learn @B first,&rdquo; I say.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I never said that,&rdquo; Carol snaps.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Oh, then&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;How many times do I have to tell you? Only listen to me. If it doesn&rsquo;t come out of my mouth, it doesn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve had Earl tell me about tasks before&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Enough. Get to work. I want this done by end of day.&rdquo; She turns on her heel and huffs away.</p>
                <p>
                    I can&rsquo;t win.</p>
                <p>
                    I work late, well past sunset, but I manage to finish everything Carol wants. I don&rsquo;t like to go home when it&rsquo;s light anyway. There&rsquo;s too much time to fill. The dark comforts me. It reminds me that my suffering is almost over.</p>
                <p>
                    After the two-hour drive home, I change into pajamas and crawl into bed. This is the hardest part of the day, when I&rsquo;m alone, when there&rsquo;s nothing to distract me. I immediately turn on the television and flip through the channels, frantic to fill my mind with something besides regret, guilt, and grief.</p>
                <p>
                    I land on a late-night talk show. A host I&rsquo;m unfamiliar with interviews a cast of actors. They&rsquo;re promoting a period piece set in New England, where I grew up in a neglected orphanage with a marginal education. There is such charisma between the actors. They joke and tease, revealing the underlying friendships between them. A pang of loneliness stabs my chest. I don&rsquo;t connect with anyone anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    Television was a bad decision. I turn it off and brush my teeth, wash my face. Reluctant, I look in the mirror. There are circles under my hollowed, brown eyes. My dark curls are a haggard mess. Stray gray hairs poke through here and there. My copper skin has lost its sheen. The beginnings of fine lines hint at wrinkles to come. I was never beautiful, but I used to be somewhat attractive. What would he think if he saw me now?</p>
                <p>
                    In five years, I look fifteen years older. And I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m not her. I&rsquo;m not anyone.</p>
                <p>
                    I return to bed. Relief spreads through me. I made it. Another day done. Another day closer to the end.</p>
                <p>
                    I fall into the dreamless dark.</p>
                <p>
                    And repeat.</p>
